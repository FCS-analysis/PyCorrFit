0.7.5
 - Added model functions to documentation.
 - Weights from fitting are now exported in .csv files.
 - Rework of info panel for fitting
 - Cleared unintuitive behavior of session saving:
   The fitting parameters were read from the frontend. This could have
   led to saving false fit meta data.
 - During fitting, units are now displayed as "human readable" (#17).
 - Slider simulation now also uses human readable units (#17).
 - Secured support for Ubuntu 12.10 and 13.04
 - Fixed: new line (\n) characters for LaTeX plotting on Windows
0.7.4
 - New tool: Colorful curve selection
 - Import data: Curve selection possible
 - Average: Crop average according to current page.
 - Fixed: Page now displays Chi² of global fit.
 - Fixed: Chi² and parameters of global fitting are now stored in sessions.
0.7.3
 - Issue closed. External weights from averages saved in session (#11).
 - Solved minor bugs
 - Added estimation of errors of fit (Issue #12/#14)
 - fixed: Some .fcs files containing averages were not imported.
0.7.2
 - Bugfix: Issue #10; we now have a goodness of the fit, if weighted
           fitting is performed
 - Bugfix: Weights for fitting not properly calculated (sqrt(std)).
 - Bugfix: Batch control IndexError with Info window opened
 - Tool Statistics: Sort values according to page numbers
 - Tool global: Added weighted fitting
 - Residuals: According to weighted fitting, weighted residuals are plotted
 - Average: Variances from averaging can be used for weighted fitting
0.7.1
 - Feature: Added Python shell
 - Bugfix: Saving image was not performed using WXAgg
 - Bugfix: Notebook pages were drag'n'dropable
 - Update function now works in its own thread
 - Code cleanup: documentation of model functions
 - Added program icon
0.7.0
 - File import dialog was enhanced (#4, #5 - subsequently #7, #8):
    - Now there is only one "load data" dialog in the file menu.
    - The model function is chosen for each type of data that is 
       to be imported (AC, CC, etc.).
    - Loading files that do not contain data a pointed out to the
      user and the program continues with the other files.
 - Bugfix: Channel selection window causes crash on file import (#1).
 - Bugfix: Hidden feature changes fixed parameters during fitting (#2).
 - Feature: Convert TIR model function parameters lambda and NA to sigma (#3).
 - Code cleanup: Opening data files is now handled internally differently.
0.6.9
 - Initital GitHub commit
