0.7.8
- Enhancements:
   - Averages can now be calculated from user-selected pages
   - Pages selected in the Overlay tool are now automatically set
     for computation of average and for global fitting
   - Source pages are now displayed in average title

   - Overlay tool displayed last curve after all pages have been removed
   - Global fit did not work with weights
- Session saving now uses 20 digits accuracy
- CSV export is now using tab-delimited data for easier Excel-import
- Added version checking for session management
0.7.7
- Fixed: Tools windows could not be closed (or moved on MS Windows)
- Fixed: .csv export failed in some cases where no weights were used
- Enhancement: The user is now asked before a page is closed
- Enhancement: Tool "Page Info" and in exported .csv files, variables and
               values are now separated by a tab stop instead of a "="
- Fixed: Opening a session with an empty page failed in some cases
- Fixed: Tool "Statistics" missed to output the column "filename/title"
         if that key value is empty - replaced empty strings with "NoName"
- Enhancement: Tool "Overlay" now asks the user to check kept curves
               instead of showing the curves to be removed
- Enhancement: Tool "Overlay" now has a "Cancel" button
0.7.6
- Improved handling
   - Tools are now sorted according to a standard work-flow
   - Renamed "Curve selection" to "Overlay tool" - this is more intuitive
   - Tools will now stay open or may be opened when there are no open pages (#25)
   - Filenames and runs are now displayed on each page (also added filename/title tag) (#23)
   - Notebook: moved close button to each tab to prevent accidental closing of tabs
- Improved tool "Statistics" (#21)
   - Fixed the case where "useless" data was produced - instead we write "NaN" data,
     removed warning message accordingly
   - Row-wise ordering according to page numbers (#22)
   - Column-wise ordering is now more intuitive
     (Fitted parameters with errors first)
   - Some columns are now checked by default
   - PyCorrFit remembers checked parameters for a page (not saved in session)
- Improved tool "Overlay" (#23)
   - New feature: Overlay shows run number of each file (upon import),
     the run (or index) of an experimental file is unique to PyCorrFit
   - Upon import, filenames and runs are displayed
   - In a session, the filename/title is displayed
- Web address of PyCorrFit changed
  from "fcstools.dyndns.org/pycorrfit" to "pycorrfit.craban.de"
- Minor bugfixes: Batch control, Global fitting, import dialog
0.7.5
 - Added model functions to documentation.
 - Weights from fitting are now exported in .csv files.
 - Rework of info panel for fitting
 - Cleared unintuitive behavior of session saving:
   The fitting parameters were read from the frontend. This could have
   led to saving false fit meta data.
 - During fitting, units are now displayed as "human readable" (#17).
 - Slider simulation now also uses human readable units (#17).
 - Secured support for Ubuntu 12.10 and 13.04
 - Fixed: new line (\n) characters for LaTeX plotting on Windows
0.7.4
 - New tool: Colorful curve selection
 - Import data: Curve selection possible
 - Average: Crop average according to current page.
 - Fixed: Page now displays Chi-squared of global fit.
 - Fixed: Chi-squared and parameters of global fitting are now stored in sessions.
0.7.3
 - Issue closed. External weights from averages saved in session (#11).
 - Solved minor bugs
 - Added estimation of errors of fit (Issue #12/#14)
 - Fixed: Some .fcs files containing averages were not imported.
0.7.2
 - Bugfix: Issue #10; we now have a goodness of the fit, if weighted
    fitting is performed
 - Bugfix: Weights for fitting not properly calculated (sqrt(std)).
 - Bugfix: Batch control IndexError with Info window opened
 - Tool Statistics: Sort values according to page numbers
 - Tool global: Added weighted fitting
 - Residuals: According to weighted fitting, weighted residuals are plotted
 - Average: Variances from averaging can be used for weighted fitting
0.7.1
 - Feature: Added Python shell
 - Bugfix: Saving image was not performed using WXAgg
 - Bugfix: Notebook pages were drag'n'dropable
 - Update function now works in its own thread
 - Code cleanup: documentation of model functions
 - Added program icon
0.7.0
 - File import dialog was enhanced (#4, #5 - subsequently #7, #8):
   - Now there is only one "load data" dialog in the file menu.
   - The model function is chosen for each type of data that is 
      to be imported (AC, CC, etc.).
   - Loading files that do not contain data a pointed out to the
     user and the program continues with the other files.
 - Bugfix: Channel selection window causes crash on file import (#1).
 - Bugfix: Hidden feature changes fixed parameters during fitting (#2).
 - Feature: Convert TIR model function parameters lambda and NA to sigma (#3).
 - Code cleanup: Opening data files is now handled internally differently.
0.6.9
 - Initital GitHub commit
