  abstract = {Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) is carried out with an
	electron multiplying CCD (EMCCD). This new strategy is compared to
	standard detection by an avalanche photo diode showing good agreement
	with respect to the resulting autocorrelation curves. Applying different
	readout modes, a time resolution of 20 {\textmu}s can be achieved,
	which is sufficient to resolve the diffusion of free dye in solution.
	The advantages of implementing EMCCD cameras in wide-field ultra
	low light imaging, as well as in multi-spot confocal laser scanning
	microscopy, can consequently also be exploited for spatially resolved
	FCS. First proof-of-principle FCS measurements with two excitation
	volumes demonstrate the advantage of the flexible CCD area detection.},

	generated by epi-illumination through the periphery of a high NA
	oil-immersion objective. The main advantages with respect to conventional
	FCS systems are an improvement in terms of counts per molecule (cpm)
	and a high signal to background ratio. This is demonstrated by investigating
	diffusion as well as binding and release of single molecules on a
	glass surface. Furthermore, the size and shape of the molecule detection
	efficiency (MDE) function was calculated, using a wave-vectorial
	approach and taking into account the influence of the dielectric
	interface on the emission properties of fluorophores.},

  abstract = {We characterize a novel fluorescence microscope which combines the
	high spatial discrimination of a total internal reflection epi-fluorescence
	(epi-TIRF) microscope with that of stimulated emission depletion
	(STED) nanoscopy. This combination of high axial confinement and
	dynamic-active lateral spatial discrimination of the detected fluorescence
	emission promises imaging and spectroscopy of the structure and function
	of cell membranes at the macro-molecular scale. Following a full
	theoretical description of the sampling volume and the recording
	of images of fluorescent beads, we exemplify the performance and
	limitations of the TIRF-STED nanoscope with particular attention
	to the polarization state of the laser excitation light. We demonstrate
	fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) with the TIRF-STED nanoscope
	by observing the diffusion of dye molecules in aqueous solutions
	and of fluorescent lipid analogs in supported lipid bilayers in the
	presence of background signal. The nanoscope reduced the out-of-focus
	background signal. A lateral resolution down to 40--50 nm was attained
	which was ultimately limited by the low lateral signal-to-background
	ratio inherent to the confocal epi-TIRF scheme. Together with the
	estimated axial confinement of about 55 nm, our TIRF-STED nanoscope
	achieved an almost isotropic and less than 1 attoliter small all-optically
	induced measurement volume.},

  abstract = {Fast excitation-driven fluctuations in the fluorescence emission of
	yellow-shifted green fluorescent protein mutants T203Y and T203F,
	with S65G/S72A, are discovered in the 10−6–10−3-s time range, by
	using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy at 10−8 M. This intensity-dependent
	flickering is conspicuous at high pH, with rate constants independent
	of pH and viscosity with a minor temperature effect. The mean flicker
	rate increases linearly with excitation intensity for at least three
	decades, but the mean dark fraction of the molecules undergoing these
	dynamics is independent of illumination intensity over ≈6 × 102 to
	5 × 106 W/cm2. These results suggest that optical excitation establishes
	an equilibration between two molecular states of different spectroscopic
	properties that are coupled only via the excited state as a gateway.
	This reversible excitation-driven transition has a quantum efficiency
	of ≈10−3. Dynamics of external protonation, reversibly quenching
	the fluorescence, are also observed at low pH in the 10- to 100-μs
	time range. The independence of these two bright–dark flicker processes
	implies the existence of at least two separate dark states of these
	green fluorescent protein mutants. Time-resolved fluorescence measurements
	reveal a single exponential decay of the excited state population
	with 3.8-ns lifetime, after 500-nm excitation, that is pH independent.
	Our fluorescence correlation spectroscopy results are discussed in
	terms of recent theoretical studies that invoke isomerization of
	the chromophore as a nonradiative channel of the excited state relaxation.},

	Total internal reflection fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy
	(TIR-FCCS). Fluorescent tracers flowing with the liquid are excited
	by evanescent light, produced by epi-illumination through the periphery
	of a high numerical aperture oil-immersion objective. The time-resolved
	fluorescence intensity signals from two laterally shifted observation
	volumes, created by two confocal pinholes are independently measured.
	The cross-correlation of these signals provides information of the
	tracers' velocities. By changing the evanescent wave penetration
	depth, flow profiling at distances less than 200 nm from the interface
	can be performed. Due to the high sensitivity of the method fluorescent
	species with different size, down to single dye molecules can be
	used as tracers. We applied this method to study the flow of aqueous
	electrolyte solutions near a smooth hydrophilic surface and explored
	the effect of several important parameters, e.g. tracer size, ionic
	strength, and distance between the observation volumes.},
