    In current biomedical research, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS)
    is applied to characterize molecular dynamic processes in vitro and in living
    cells. Commercial FCS setups only permit data analysis that is limited to a
    specific instrument by the use of in-house file formats or a finite number of
    implemented correlation model functions. PyCorrFit is a general-purpose FCS
    evaluation software that, amongst other formats, supports the established Zeiss
    ConfoCor3 ~.fcs file format. PyCorrFit comes with several built-in model
    functions, covering a wide range of applications in standard confocal FCS.
    In addition, it contains equations dealing with different excitation geometries
    like total internal reflection (TIR).
