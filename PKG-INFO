        =========
        
        This repository contains the source code of PyCorrFit - a scientific tool for fitting
        correlation curves on a logarithmic plot.
        
        In current biomedical research, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) is  applied
        to characterize molecular dynamic processes in vitro and in living cells.  Commercial
        FCS setups only permit data analysis that is limited to  a specific instrument by
        the use of in-house file formats or a  finite number of implemented correlation
        model functions. PyCorrFit is a general-purpose FCS evaluation software that,
        amongst other formats, supports the established Zeiss ConfoCor3 ~.fcs  file format.
        PyCorrFit comes with several built-in model functions, covering a wide range of
        applications in standard confocal FCS. In addition, it contains equations dealing
        with different excitation geometries like total internal reflection (TIR). For more
        information, visit the official homepage at http://pycorrfit.craban.de.
