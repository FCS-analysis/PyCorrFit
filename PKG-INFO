        =========
        
        In current research, fluorescence correlation spectrsocopy (FCS) is  applied to
        characterize dynamical processes in vitro and in vivo.  Commercial FCS setups only
        permit data analysis that is limited to  a specific instrument by the use of in-house
        file formats or a  finite number of implemented correlation model functions.
        PyCorrFit is a general-purpose FCS evaluation software that,  amongst other formats,
        supports the established ConfoCor3 ~.fcs  file format and which comes with several
        built-in model functions,  covering a wide range of applications including multiple
        diffusional  species or total internal reflection (TIR-) FCS. For more information, visit the official homepage at http://pycorrfit.craban.de.
