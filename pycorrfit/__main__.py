    When a membrane is scanned perpendicularly to its surface, the
    fluorescence signal originating from the membrane itself must be
    separated from the signal of the surrounding medium for an FCS
    analysis. PyCorrFit interactively extracts the fluctuating
    fluorescence signal from such measurements and applies a
    multiple-tau algorithm. The obtained correlation curves can be
    evaluated using PyCorrFit.
