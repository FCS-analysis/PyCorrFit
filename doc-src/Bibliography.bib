	fluctuations of green fluorescent protein mutants EGFP (F64L/S65T)
	and GFP-S65T in small ensembles of molecules in solution by using
	fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). FCS utilizes time-resolved
	measurements of fluctuations in the molecular fluorescence emission
	for determination of the intrinsic dynamics and thermodynamics of
	all processes that affect the fluorescence. Fluorescence excitation
	of a bulk solution of EGFP decreases to zero at low pH (pKa = 5.8)
	paralleled by a decrease of the absorption at 488 nm and an increase
	at 400 nm. Protonation of the hydroxyl group of Tyr-66, which is
	part of the chromophore, induces these changes. When FCS is used
	the fluctuations in the protonation state of the chromophore are
	time resolved. The autocorrelation function of fluorescence emission
	shows contributions from two chemical relaxation processes as well
	as diffusional concentration fluctuations. The time constant of the
	fast, pH-dependent chemical process decreases with pH from 300 μs
	at pH 7 to 45 μs at pH 5, while the time-average fraction of molecules
	in a nonfluorescent state increases to 80% in the same range. A second,
	pH-independent, process with a time constant of 340 μs and an associated
	fraction of 13% nonfluorescent molecules is observed between pH 8
	and 11, possibly representing an internal proton transfer process
	and associated conformational rearrangements. The FCS data provide
	direct measures of the dynamics and the equilibrium properties of
	the protonation processes. Thus FCS is a convenient, intrinsically
	calibrated method for pH measurements in subfemtoliter volumes with

	to the polarization state of the laser excitation light. We demonstrate
	fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) with the TIRF-STED nanoscope
	by observing the diffusion of dye molecules in aqueous solutions
	and of fluorescent lipid analogs in supported lipid bilayers in the
	presence of background signal. The nanoscope reduced the out-of-focus
	background signal. A lateral resolution down to 40--50 nm was attained
	which was ultimately limited by the low lateral signal-to-background
	ratio inherent to the confocal epi-TIRF scheme. Together with the
	estimated axial confinement of about 55 nm, our TIRF-STED nanoscope
	achieved an almost isotropic and less than 1 attoliter small all-optically

  abstract = {Fast excitation-driven fluctuations in the fluorescence emission of
	yellow-shifted green fluorescent protein mutants T203Y and T203F,
	with S65G/S72A, are discovered in the 10−6–10−3-s time range, by
	using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy at 10−8 M. This intensity-dependent
	flickering is conspicuous at high pH, with rate constants independent
	of pH and viscosity with a minor temperature effect. The mean flicker
	rate increases linearly with excitation intensity for at least three
	decades, but the mean dark fraction of the molecules undergoing these
	dynamics is independent of illumination intensity over ≈6 × 102 to
	5 × 106 W/cm2. These results suggest that optical excitation establishes
	an equilibration between two molecular states of different spectroscopic
	properties that are coupled only via the excited state as a gateway.
	This reversible excitation-driven transition has a quantum efficiency
	of ≈10−3. Dynamics of external protonation, reversibly quenching
	the fluorescence, are also observed at low pH in the 10- to 100-μs
	time range. The independence of these two bright–dark flicker processes
	implies the existence of at least two separate dark states of these

	reveal a single exponential decay of the excited state population

	Our fluorescence correlation spectroscopy results are discussed in

	the chromophore as a nonradiative channel of the excited state relaxation.},

  abstract = {Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) uses a stationary laser
	beam to illuminate a small sample volume and analyze the temporal
	behavior of the fluorescence fluctuations within the stationary observation
	volume. In contrast, scanning FCS (SFCS) collects the fluorescence
	signal from a moving observation volume by scanning the laser beam.
	The fluctuations now contain both temporal and spatial information
	about the sample. To access the spatial information we synchronize
	scanning and data acquisition. Synchronization allows us to evaluate
	correlations for every position along the scanned trajectory. We
	use a circular scan trajectory in this study. Because the scan radius
	is constant, the phase angle is sufficient to characterize the position
	of the beam. We introduce position-sensitive SFCS (PSFCS), where
	correlations are calculated as a function of lag time and phase.
	We present the theory of PSFCS and derive expressions for diffusion,
	diffusion in the presence of flow, and for immobilization. To test
	PSFCS we compare experimental data with theory. We determine the
	direction and speed of a flowing dye solution and the position of
	an immobilized particle. To demonstrate the feasibility of the technique
	for applications in living cells we present data of enhanced green
	fluorescent protein measured in the nucleus of COS cells.},
