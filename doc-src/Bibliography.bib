  abstract = {We comprehensively study the least-squares Gaussian approximations
	of the diffraction-limited 2D-3D paraxial-nonparaxial point-spread
	functions (PSFs)of the wide field fluorescence microscope (WFFM),
	the laser scanning confocal microscope(LSCM), and the disk scanning
	confocal microscope (DSCM). The PSFs are expressed using the Debye
	integral. Under anL$\infty$ constraint imposing peak matching, optimal
	and near-optimal Gaussian parameters are derived for the PSFs. With
	anL1 constraint imposing energy conservation, an optimal Gaussian
	parameter is derived for the 2D paraxial WFFM PSF. We found that
	(1) the 2D approximations are all very accurate; (2) no accurate
	Gaussian approximation exists for 3D WFFM PSFs; and (3) with typical
	pinhole sizes, the 3D approximations are accurate for the DSCM and
	nearly perfect for the LSCM. All the Gaussian parameters derived
	in this study are in explicit analytical form, allowing their direct
	use in practical applications.},
