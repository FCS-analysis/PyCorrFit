   abstract = {We present a new method to measure absolute diffusion coefficients at nanomolar concentrations with high precision. Based on a modified fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS)-setup, this method is improved by introducing an external ruler for measuring the diffusion time by generating two laterally shifted and overlapping laser foci at a fixed and known distance. Data fitting is facilitated by a new two-parameter model to describe the molecule detection function (MDF). We present a recorded MDF and show the excellent agreement with the fitting model. We measure the diffusion coefficient of the red fluorescent dye Atto655 under various conditions and compare these values with a value achieved by gradient pulsed field NMR (GPF NMR). From these measurements we conclude, that the new measurement scheme is robust against optical and photophysical artefacts which are inherent to standard FCS. With two-focus-FCS, the diffusion coefficient of 4.26 x 10(-6) cm2s(-1) for Atto655 in water at 25 degrees C compares well with the GPF NMR value of 4.28 x 10(-6) cm2s(-1).},

   abstract = {We have implemented scanning fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (sFCS) for precise determination of diffusion coefficients of fluorescent molecules in solution. The measurement volume where the molecules are excited, and from which the fluorescence is detected, was scanned in a circle with radius comparable to its size at frequencies 0.5-2 kHz. The scan radius R, determined with high accuracy by careful calibration, provides the spatial measure required for the determination of the diffusion coefficient D, without the need to know the exact size of the measurement volume. The difficulties in the determination of the measurement volume size have limited the application of standard FCS with fixed measurement volume to relative measurements, where the diffusion coefficient is determined by comparison with a standard. We demonstrate, on examples of several common fluorescent dyes, that sFCS can be used to measure D with high precision without a need for a standard. The correct value of D can be determined in the presence of weak photobleaching, and when the measurement volume size is modified, indicating the robustness of the method. The applicability of the presented implementation of sFCS to biological systems in demonstrated on the measurement of the diffusion coefficient of eGFP in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells. With the help of simulations, we find the optimal value of the scan radius R for the experiment.},

Here we review basic principles of FCCS and focus on seminal applications, including examples of intracellular signaling and trafficking. We consider FCCS in the context of fluorescence resonance energy transfer and multicolor imaging techniques and discuss application strategies and recent technical advances.},

   abstract = {Dual-color fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (dcFCCS) allows one to quantitatively assess the interactions of mobile molecules labeled with distinct fluorophores. The technique is widely applied to both reconstituted and live-cell biological systems. A major drawback of dcFCCS is the risk of an artifactual false-positive or overestimated cross-correlation amplitude arising from spectral cross-talk. Cross-talk can be reduced or prevented by fast alternating excitation, but the technology is not easily implemented in standard commercial setups. An experimental strategy is devised that does not require specialized hardware and software for recognizing and correcting for cross-talk in standard dcFCCS. The dependence of the cross-talk on particle concentrations and brightnesses is quantitatively confirmed. Moreover, it is straightforward to quantitatively correct for cross-talk using quickly accessible parameters, that is, the measured (apparent) fluorescence count rates and correlation amplitudes. Only the bleed-through ratio needs to be determined in a calibration measurement. Finally, the limitations of cross-talk correction and its influence on experimental error are explored.},

   abstract = {Fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) is used to determine interactions and dissociation constants (K(d)s) of biomolecules. The determination of a K(d) depends on the accurate measurement of the auto- and cross-correlation function (ACF and CCF) amplitudes. In the case of complete binding, the ratio of the CCF/ACF amplitudes is expected to be 1. However, measurements performed on tandem fluorescent proteins (FPs), in which two different FPs are linked, yield CCF/ACF amplitude ratios of approximately 0.5 or less for different FCCS schemes. We use single wavelength FCCS and pulsed interleaved excitation FCCS to measure various tandem FPs constituted of different red and green FPs and determine the causes for this suboptimal ratio. The main causes for the reduced CCF/ACF amplitude ratio are differences in observation volumes for the different labels, the existence of dark FPs due to maturation problems, photobleaching, and to a lesser extent Forster (or fluorescence) resonance energy transfer between the labels. We deduce the fraction of nonfluorescent proteins for EGFP, mRFP, and mCherry as well as the differences in observation volumes. We use this information to correct FCCS measurements of the interaction of Cdc42, a small Rho-GTPase, with its effector IQGAP1 in live cell measurements to obtain a label-independent value for the K(d).},

   abstract = {We have investigated the pH dependence of the dynamics of conformational fluctuations of green fluorescent protein mutants EGFP (F64L/S65T) and GFP-S65T in small ensembles of molecules in solution by using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). FCS utilizes time-resolved measurements of fluctuations in the molecular fluorescence emission for determination of the intrinsic dynamics and thermodynamics of all processes that affect the fluorescence. Fluorescence excitation of a bulk solution of EGFP decreases to zero at low pH (pKa = 5.8) paralleled by a decrease of the absorption at 488 nm and an increase at 400 nm. Protonation of the hydroxyl group of Tyr-66, which is part of the chromophore, induces these changes. When FCS is used the fluctuations in the protonation state of the chromophore are time resolved. The autocorrelation function of fluorescence emission shows contributions from two chemical relaxation processes as well as diffusional concentration fluctuations. The time constant of the fast, pH-dependent chemical process decreases with pH from 300 microseconds at pH 7 to 45 microseconds at pH 5, while the time-average fraction of molecules in a nonfluorescent state increases to 80% in the same range. A second, pH-independent, process with a time constant of 340 microseconds and an associated fraction of 13% nonfluorescent molecules is observed between pH 8 and 11, possibly representing an internal proton transfer process and associated conformational rearrangements. The FCS data provide direct measures of the dynamics and the equilibrium properties of the protonation processes. Thus FCS is a convenient, intrinsically calibrated method for pH measurements in subfemtoliter volumes with nanomolar concentrations of EGFP.},

   abstract = {Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) is an ideal analytical tool for studying concentrations, propagation, interactions and internal dynamics of molecules at nanomolar concentrations in living cells. FCS analyzes minute fluorescence-intensity fluctuations about the equilibrium of a small ensemble (<10(3)) of molecules. These fluctuations act like a 'fingerprint' of a molecular species detected when entering and leaving a femtoliter-sized optically defined observation volume created by a focused laser beam. In FCS the fluorescence fluctuations are recorded as a function of time and then statistically analyzed by autocorrelation analysis. The resulting autocorrelation curve yields a measure of self-similarity of the system after a certain time delay, and its amplitude describes the normalized variance of the fluorescence fluctuations. By fitting the curves to an appropriate physical model, this method provides precise information about a multitude of measurement parameters, including diffusion coefficients, local concentration, states of aggregation and molecular interactions. FCS operates in real time with diffraction-limited spatial and sub-microsecond temporal resolution. Assessing diverse molecular dynamics within the living cell is a challenge well met by FCS because of its single-molecule sensitivity and high dynamic resolution. For these same reasons, however, intracellular FCS measurements also harbor the large risk of collecting artifacts and thus producing erroneous data. Here we provide a step-by-step guide to the application of FCS to cellular systems, including methods for minimizing artifacts, optimizing measurement conditions and obtaining parameter values in the face of diverse and complex conditions of the living cell. A discussion of advantages and disadvantages of one-photon versus two-photon excitation for FCS is available in Supplementary Methods online.},

Giant unilamellar vesicles of dilauroyl phosphatidylcholine/dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DLPC/DPPC)/cholesterol were imaged by confocal fluorescence microscopy with two fluorescent probes, 1, 1'-dieicosanyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI-C(20)) and 2-(4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a, 4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-pentanoyl)-1-hexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3 -phosphoc holine (Bodipy-PC). Phase separation was visualized by differential probe partition into the coexisting phases. Three-dimensional image reconstructions of confocal z-scans through giant unilamellar vesicles reveal the anisotropic morphology of coexisting phase domains on the surface of these vesicles with full two-dimensional resolution. This method demonstrates by direct visualization the exact superposition of like phase domains in apposing monolayers, thus answering a long-standing open question. Cholesterol was found to induce a marked change in the phase boundary shapes of the coexisting phase domains. To further characterize the phases, the translational diffusion coefficient, D(T), of the DiI-C(20) was measured by FCS. D(T) values at approximately 25 degrees C ranged from approximately 3 x 10(-8) cm(2)/s in the fluid phase, to approximately 2 x 10(-9) cm(2)/s in high-cholesterol-content phases, to approximately 2 x 10(-10) cm(2)/s in the spatially ordered phases that coexist with fluid phases. In favorable cases, FCS could distinguish two different values of D(T) in a region of two-phase coexistence on a single vesicle.},

The autocorrelation function for two different particles in solution were computed, statistical noise was added, and the resulting curve was fitted with a least squares fit. These simulations show that the ability to distinguish between two different molecular species in solution depends strongly on the number of photons detected from each particle, their difference in size, and the concentration of each component in solution. To distinguish two components, their diffusion times must differ by at least a factor of 1.6 for comparable quantum yields and a high fluorescence signal. Experiments were conducted with Rhodamine 6G and Rhodamine-labeled bovine serum albumin. The experimental results support the simulations. In addition, they show that even with a high fluorescence signal but significantly different quantum yields, the diffusion times must differ by a factor much bigger than 1.6 to distinguish the two components. Depending on the quantum yields and the difference in size, there exists a concentration threshold for the less abundant component below which it is not possible to determine with statistical means alone that two particles are in solution.},

Here, for the first time, we extend TIR-FCS to a cellular application for measuring the lateral diffusion of a membrane-binding fluorescent protein, farnesylated EGFP, on the plasma membranes of cultured HeLa and COS7 cells. We detected two kinds of diffusional motion-fast three-dimensional diffusion (D(1)) and much slower two-dimensional diffusion (D(2)), simultaneously. Conventional FCS and single-molecule tracking confirmed that D(1) was free diffusion of farnesylated EGFP close to the plasma membrane in cytosol and D(2) was lateral diffusion in the plasma membrane. These results suggest that TIR-FCS is a powerful technique to monitor movement of membrane-localized molecules and membrane dynamics in living cells.},

The introduction of a characteristic function, the collection efficiency function (CEF), provides a quantitative theoretical analysis of this system, which yields an interpretation of the FCS and FPR measurements in three dimensions. We demonstrate that when the proper field diaphragm is introduced, the 3-D FCS measurements can be mimicked by a 2-D theory with only minor error. The FPR characteristic recovery time for diffusion is expected to be slightly longer than the corresponding time measured by FCS in the same conditions. This is because the profile of the laser beam used for photobleaching is not affected by the field diaphragm. The CEF is also important for quantitative analysis of standard scanning confocal microscopy when it is carried out using a finite detection pinhole.},

   abstract = {Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy with total internal reflection excitation (TIR-FCS) is a promising method with emerging biological applications for measuring binding dynamics of fluorescent molecules to a planar substrate as well as diffusion coefficients and concentrations at the interface. Models for correlation functions proposed so far are rather approximate for most conditions, since they neglect lateral diffusion of fluorophores. Here we propose accurate extensions of previously published models for axial correlation functions taking into account lateral diffusion through detection profiles realized in typical experiments. In addition, we consider the effects of surface-generated emission in objective-based TIR-FCS. The expressions for correlation functions presented here will facilitate quantitative and accurate measurements with TIR-FCS.},

A considerable decrease in background light intensity and measurement time has been observed. The background light is 40 times weaker than the fluorescence signal from one molecule of Rh6G, and the correlation function with signal-to-noise ratio of 150 can be collected in 1 second. The effect of the shape of the sample volume on the autocorrelation function has been discussed.},

This process involves phosphorylation of NtrC (NtrC-P), assembly of an octameric NtrC-P complex at the enhancer DNA sequence, interaction of this complex with promoter-bound RNAP x sigma(54) via DNA looping, and hydrolysis of ATP. Here it is demonstrated by two-color fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy measurements of 6-carboxyfluorescein and 6-carboxy-X-rhodamine-labeled DNA oligonucleotide duplexes that the NtrC-P complex can bind two DNA duplexes simultaneously.

   abstract = {Multiphoton excitation (MPE) of fluorescent probes has become an attractive alternative in biological applications of laser scanning microscopy because many problems encountered in spectroscopic measurements of living tissue such as light scattering, autofluorescence, and photodamage can be reduced. The present study investigates the characteristics of two-photon excitation (2PE) in comparison with confocal one-photon excitation (1PE) for intracellular applications of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). FCS is an attractive method of measuring molecular concentrations, mobility parameters, chemical kinetics, and fluorescence photophysics. Several FCS applications in mammalian and plant cells are outlined, to illustrate the capabilities of both 1PE and 2PE. Photophysical properties of fluorophores required for quantitative FCS in tissues are analyzed. Measurements in live cells and on cell membranes are feasible with reasonable signal-to-noise ratios, even with fluorophore concentrations as low as the single-molecule level in the sampling volume. Molecular mobilities can be measured over a wide range of characteristic time constants from approximately 10(-3) to 10(3) ms. While both excitation alternatives work well for intracellular FCS in thin preparations, 2PE can substantially improve signal quality in turbid preparations like plant cells and deep cell layers in tissue. At comparable signal levels, 2PE minimizes photobleaching in spatially restrictive cellular compartments, thereby preserving long-term signal acquisition.},

By using two differently labeled reaction partners, the selectivity to investigate the temporal evolution of reaction product is significantly increased compared to ordinary one-color fluorescence autocorrelation systems. Here we develop the theoretical and experimental basis for carrying out measurements in a confocal dual-beam fluorescence correlation spectroscopy setup and discuss conditions that are favorable for cross-correlation analysis. The measurement principle is explained for carrying out DNA-DNA renaturation kinetics with two differently labeled complementary strands. The concentration of the reaction product can be directly determined from the cross-correlation amplitude.},

   abstract = {Total internal reflection with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (TIR-FCS) is a method for measuring the surface association/dissociation rates and absolute densities of fluorescent molecules at the interface of solution and a planar substrate. This method can also report the apparent diffusion coefficient and absolute concentration of fluorescent molecules very close to the surface. An expression for the fluorescence fluctuation autocorrelation function in the absence of contributions from diffusion through the evanescent wave, in solution, has been published previously (N. L. Thompson, T. P. Burghardt, and D. Axelrod. 1981, Biophys. J. 33:435-454). This work describes the nature of the TIR-FCS autocorrelation function when both surface association/dissociation kinetics and diffusion through the evanescent wave contribute to the fluorescence fluctuations. The fluorescence fluctuation autocorrelation function depends in general on the kinetic association and dissociation rate constants, the surface site density, the concentration of fluorescent molecules in solution, the solution diffusion coefficient, and the depth of the evanescent field. Both general and approximate expressions are presented.},

   abstract = {We have investigated spatial variations of the diffusion behavior of the green fluorescent protein mutant EGFP (F64L/S65T) and of the EGFP-beta-galactosidase fusion protein in living cells with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. Our fluorescence correlation spectroscopy device, in connection with a precision x-y translation stage, provides submicron spatial resolution and a detection volume smaller than a femtoliter. The fluorescence fluctuations in cell lines expressing EGFP are caused by molecular diffusion as well as a possible internal and a pH-dependent external protonation process of the EGFP chromophore. The latter processes result in two apparent nonfluorescent states that have to be taken into account when evaluating the fluorescence correlation spectroscopy data. The diffusional contribution deviates from ideal behavior and depends on the position in the cell. The fluorescence correlation spectroscopy data can either be evaluated as a two component model with one fraction of the molecules undergoing free Brownian motion with a diffusion coefficient approximately five times smaller than in aqueous solution, and another fraction diffusing one or two orders of magnitude slower. This latter component is especially noticeable in the nuclei. Alternatively, we can fit the data to an anomalous diffusion model where the time dependence of the diffusion serves as a measure for the degree of obstruction, which is large especially in nuclei. Possible mechanisms for this long tail behavior include corralling, immobile obstacles, and binding with a broad distribution of binding affinities. The results are consistent with recent numerical models of the chromosome territory structure in the cell nucleus.},

The measured fluctuating signal is correlated in time and analyzed with appropriate model functions containing the parameters that describe the underlying molecular behavior. The dual-color extension, fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) allows for a comparison between spectrally well-separated channels to extract codiffusion events that reflect interactions between differently labeled molecules. In addition to solution measurements, FCCS can be applied with subcellular resolution and is therefore a very promising approach for a quantitative biochemical assessment of molecular networks in living cells. To derive thermodynamic and kinetic reaction parameters, the influence of a number of other factors like background noise, illumination intensity profiles, photophysical processes, and cross talk between the channels have to be treated. Here, we provide a roadmap to derive binding reaction data with dual-color FCCS using continuous wave laser excitation, as it is now accessible with many state-of-the-art confocal microscopes.},

In a two-colour setup, simultaneous detection of two different dyes allows the acquisition of both the autocorrelation of the signal of each channel and the cross-correlation of the two channels (fluorescence cross correlation spectroscopy, FCCS). The cross-correlation function is related to the amount of diffusing particles carrying both dyes and can be used for monitoring a binding reaction. Here we develop a formalism for a quantitative analysis of ligand binding from a combination of the auto- and the cross-correlation amplitudes. Technical constraints, like the focal geometry, background signal and cross-talk between the detection channels as well as photophysical and biochemical effects which modulate the brightness of the particles are included in the analysis.

   abstract = {We investigate the challenges and limitations that are encountered when studying membrane protein dynamics in vivo by means of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). Based on theoretical arguments and computer simulations, we show that, in general, the fluctuating fluorescence has a fractal dimension D(0) >or= 1.5, which is determined by the anomality alpha of the diffusional motion of the labeled particles, i.e., by the growth of their mean square displacement as (Deltax)(2) approximately t(alpha). The fractality enforces an initial power-law behavior of the autocorrelation function and related quantities for small times. Using this information, we show by FCS that Golgi resident membrane proteins move subdiffusively in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus in vivo. Based on Monte Carlo simulations for FCS on curved surfaces, we can rule out that the observed anomalous diffusion is a result of the complex topology of the membrane. The apparent mobility of particles as determined by FCS, however, is shown to depend crucially on the shape of the membrane and its motion in time. Due to this fact, the hydrodynamic radius of the tracked particles can be easily overestimated by an order of magnitude},

The experimental examples given include measurements of ion concentrations and buffer properties, electron transfer reactions, ligand-receptor interactions and diffusion of ligand-receptor complexes in cell membranes. For each of these examples the properties of the FCS technique is discussed in relation to other established techniques used for that particular application. From these examples it is found that FCS can offer important complementary information and, due to the extreme sensitivity of the technique, new information not yet explored by other methods.},

   abstract = {Total internal reflection-fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (TIR-FCS) is a powerful method for studying dynamic processes at liquid-solid interfaces that may have numerous applications in biology, physics, and material science. Despite of its power and versatility, however, the use of TIR-FCS is still rather limited. The main reason for this is the need of a complex, in-house constructed optical setup whose assembly and adjustment is a quite difficult task. Clearly, the availability of ready to use, commercial TIR-FCS setups will strongly boost the application of this important method in many research areas. In this note we show that although such setups are still not available in the market, a proper combination of commercial devices for confocal fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and for total internal reflection microscopy may enable TIR-FCS in a way that do not require any special optical alignments. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capabilities of the setup by measuring the diffusion coefficient of single dye molecule and quantum dots in the very proximity of a water-glass interface.

The PSFs are expressed using the Debye integral. Under an L(infinity) constraint imposing peak matching, optimal and near-optimal Gaussian parameters are derived for the PSFs. With an L1 constraint imposing energy conservation, an optimal Gaussian parameter is derived for the 2D paraxial WFFM PSF. We found that (1) the 2D approximations are all very accurate; (2) no accurate Gaussian approximation exists for 3D WFFM PSFs; and (3) with typical pinhole sizes, the 3D approximations are accurate for the DSCM and nearly perfect for the LSCM. All the Gaussian parameters derived in this study are in explicit analytical form, allowing their direct use in practical applications.},
