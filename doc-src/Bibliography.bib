	fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). FCS utilizes time-resolved
	measurements of fluctuations in the molecular fluorescence emission
	for determination of the intrinsic dynamics and thermodynamics of
	all processes that affect the fluorescence. Fluorescence excitation
	of a bulk solution of EGFP decreases to zero at low pH (pKa = 5.8)
	paralleled by a decrease of the absorption at 488 nm and an increase
	at 400 nm. Protonation of the hydroxyl group of Tyr-66, which is
	part of the chromophore, induces these changes. When FCS is used
	the fluctuations in the protonation state of the chromophore are
	time resolved. The autocorrelation function of fluorescence emission
	shows contributions from two chemical relaxation processes as well
	as diffusional concentration fluctuations. The time constant of the
	fast, pH-dependent chemical process decreases with pH from 300 μs
	at pH 7 to 45 μs at pH 5, while the time-average fraction of molecules
	in a nonfluorescent state increases to 80% in the same range. A second,

	dynamic-active lateral spatial discrimination of the detected fluorescence
	emission promises imaging and spectroscopy of the structure and function
	of cell membranes at the macro-molecular scale. Following a full
	theoretical description of the sampling volume and the recording
	of images of fluorescent beads, we exemplify the performance and
	limitations of the TIRF-STED nanoscope with particular attention
	to the polarization state of the laser excitation light. We demonstrate
	fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) with the TIRF-STED nanoscope
	by observing the diffusion of dye molecules in aqueous solutions
	and of fluorescent lipid analogs in supported lipid bilayers in the
	presence of background signal. The nanoscope reduced the out-of-focus
	background signal. A lateral resolution down to 40--50 nm was attained
	which was ultimately limited by the low lateral signal-to-background
	ratio inherent to the confocal epi-TIRF scheme. Together with the
	estimated axial confinement of about 55 nm, our TIRF-STED nanoscope
	achieved an almost isotropic and less than 1 attoliter small all-optically
	induced measurement volume.},

	for diffusion is expected to be slightly longer than the corresponding
	time measured by FCS in the same conditions. This is because the
	profile of the laser beam used for photobleaching is not affected

	in imaging FCS using fast, sensitive array detectors, requires the
	handling of large amounts of data. One can easily collect in excess
	of 100,000 FCS curves a day, too many to be treated manually. Therefore,
	ImFCS, an open-source software which relies on standard image files
	was developed and provides a wide range of options for the calculation
	of spatial and temporal auto- and cross-correlations, as well as
	differences in Cross-Correlation Functions (ΔCCF). ImFCS permits
	fitting of standard models to correlation functions and provides
	optimized histograms of fitted parameters. Applications include the
	measurement of diffusion and flow with Imaging Total Internal Reflection
	FCS (ITIR-FCS) and Single Plane Illumination Microscopy FCS (SPIM-FCS)
	in biologically relevant samples. As a compromise between ITIR-FCS
	and SPIM-FCS, we extend the applications to Imaging Variable Angle-FCS
	(IVA-FCS) where sub-critical oblique illumination provides sample
	sectioning close to the cover slide.},

  abstract = {Fast excitation-driven fluctuations in the fluorescence emission of
	yellow-shifted green fluorescent protein mutants T203Y and T203F,
	with S65G/S72A, are discovered in the 10−6–10−3-s time range, by
	using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy at 10−8 M. This intensity-dependent
	flickering is conspicuous at high pH, with rate constants independent
	of pH and viscosity with a minor temperature effect. The mean flicker
	rate increases linearly with excitation intensity for at least three
	decades, but the mean dark fraction of the molecules undergoing these
	dynamics is independent of illumination intensity over ≈6 × 102 to
	5 × 106 W/cm2. These results suggest that optical excitation establishes
	an equilibration between two molecular states of different spectroscopic
	properties that are coupled only via the excited state as a gateway.
	This reversible excitation-driven transition has a quantum efficiency
	of ≈10−3. Dynamics of external protonation, reversibly quenching
	the fluorescence, are also observed at low pH in the 10- to 100-μs
	time range. The independence of these two bright–dark flicker processes
	implies the existence of at least two separate dark states of these
	green fluorescent protein mutants. Time-resolved fluorescence measurements
	reveal a single exponential decay of the excited state population
	with 3.8-ns lifetime, after 500-nm excitation, that is pH independent.
	Our fluorescence correlation spectroscopy results are discussed in
	terms of recent theoretical studies that invoke isomerization of
	the chromophore as a nonradiative channel of the excited state relaxation.},

  abstract = {Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) uses a stationary laser
	beam to illuminate a small sample volume and analyze the temporal
	behavior of the fluorescence fluctuations within the stationary observation
	volume. In contrast, scanning FCS (SFCS) collects the fluorescence
	signal from a moving observation volume by scanning the laser beam.
	The fluctuations now contain both temporal and spatial information
	about the sample. To access the spatial information we synchronize
	scanning and data acquisition. Synchronization allows us to evaluate
	correlations for every position along the scanned trajectory. We
	use a circular scan trajectory in this study. Because the scan radius
	is constant, the phase angle is sufficient to characterize the position
	of the beam. We introduce position-sensitive SFCS (PSFCS), where
	correlations are calculated as a function of lag time and phase.
	We present the theory of PSFCS and derive expressions for diffusion,
	diffusion in the presence of flow, and for immobilization. To test
	PSFCS we compare experimental data with theory. We determine the
	direction and speed of a flowing dye solution and the position of
	an immobilized particle. To demonstrate the feasibility of the technique
	for applications in living cells we present data of enhanced green
	fluorescent protein measured in the nucleus of COS cells.},

  abstract = {The life sciences require new highly sensitive imaging tools, which
	allow the quantitative measurement of molecular parameters within
	a physiological three-dimensional (3D) environment. Therefore, we
	combined single plane illumination microscopy (SPIM) with camera
	based fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). SPIM-FCS provides
	contiguous particle number and diffusion coefficient images with
	a high spatial resolution in homo- and heterogeneous 3D specimens
	and live zebrafish embryos. Our SPIM-FCS recorded up to 4096 spectra
	within 56 seconds at a laser power of 60 \&\#x03BC;W without damaging
	the embryo. This new FCS modality provides more measurements per
	time and more, less photo-toxic measurements per sample than confocal
	based methods. In essence, SPIM-FCS offers new opportunities to observe
	biomolecular interactions quantitatively and functions in a highly
	multiplexed manner within a physiologically relevant 3D environment.},

  abstract = {We present a new method to study flow of liquids near solid surface:
	Total internal reflection fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy
	(TIR-FCCS). Fluorescent tracers flowing with the liquid are excited
	by evanescent light, produced by epi-illumination through the periphery
	of a high numerical aperture oil-immersion objective. The time-resolved
	fluorescence intensity signals from two laterally shifted observation
	volumes, created by two confocal pinholes are independently measured.
	The cross-correlation of these signals provides information of the
	tracers' velocities. By changing the evanescent wave penetration
	depth, flow profiling at distances less than 200 nm from the interface
	can be performed. Due to the high sensitivity of the method fluorescent
	species with different size, down to single dye molecules can be
	used as tracers. We applied this method to study the flow of aqueous
	electrolyte solutions near a smooth hydrophilic surface and explored
	the effect of several important parameters, e.g. tracer size, ionic
	strength, and distance between the observation volumes.},

  abstract = {We comprehensively study the least-squares Gaussian approximations
	of the diffraction-limited 2D-3D paraxial-nonparaxial point-spread
	functions (PSFs)of the wide field fluorescence microscope (WFFM),
	the laser scanning confocal microscope(LSCM), and the disk scanning
	confocal microscope (DSCM). The PSFs are expressed using the Debye
	integral. Under anL$\infty$ constraint imposing peak matching, optimal
	and near-optimal Gaussian parameters are derived for the PSFs. With
	anL1 constraint imposing energy conservation, an optimal Gaussian
	parameter is derived for the 2D paraxial WFFM PSF. We found that
	(1) the 2D approximations are all very accurate; (2) no accurate
	Gaussian approximation exists for 3D WFFM PSFs; and (3) with typical
	pinhole sizes, the 3D approximations are accurate for the DSCM and
	nearly perfect for the LSCM. All the Gaussian parameters derived
	in this study are in explicit analytical form, allowing their direct
	use in practical applications.},
