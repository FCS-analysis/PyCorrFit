# Force numpy to 1.8, because the wx.lib.plot
# in Anacondas wxpython 3.0 needs np.oldnumeric.
# We also have to force lmfit to version 0.9.2,
# because newer versions complain about some
# functionality in scipy, which is not here because
# there are no new scipy builds with numpy 1.8. 
numpy 1.8.*
