# The first line of this file will be treated as the name of the model
# inside PyCorrFit. PyCorrFit will enumerate user imported models with  IDs 
# starting at 7001. You can save a session and the user defined models 
# like this one will be saved as well. Lines starting with a hash "#"
# are treated as comments. Empty lines and lines with only white space
# characters are ignored.

# Note that if your code does not work, it might be that some variables
# have other meaning. This includes using "n" instead of "N".
# If you get some Syntax Error it might be that your starting variables
# are not set to a reasonable starting function. PyCorrFit is testing the
# function with sympy (for safety) and calculates the function for 
# different values of tau.

## Definition of parameters:
# First, define the parameters and their starting values for you model
# function. If the parameter has a unit of measurement, then it may be
# added separated by a white space before the "=" sign. The starting
# value should be a floating point number. You may use abbreviations
# like "1e-3" instead of "0.001".
# Note that PyCorrFit has it's own unit system:
#  unit of time        : 1 ms
#  unit of inverse time: 1000 /s
#  unit of distance    : 100 nm
#  unit of diff.coeff  : 10 µm²/s
#  unit of inverse area: 100 /µm²
#  unit of inv. volume : 1000 /µm³

# Diffusion coefficient of first component
D1 [10 µm²/s] = 200.0

# Diffusion coefficient of second component
D2 [10 µm²/s] = 20.0

# Fraction of species One
F1 = 1.0

# Half waist of the lateral detection area (w0 = 2*a)
a [100 nm] = 1.0

# Particle number
n = 5.0

# Scan radius
R [100 nm] = 3.850

# Frequency
f [kHz] = .2

# Triplet fraction
T = 0.1

# Triplet time
tautrip [ms] = 0.001

# You may choose to substitute certain parts of the correlation function
# with other values for easy reading. This can be done by using the
# prefix "g". You may use all common mathematical functions,
# such as "sqrt()" or "exp()". For convenience, "pi" and "e" may also
# be used. If you are paranoid, you always use float numbers with a dot "."
# to be sure the program doesn't accidently do integer division.

gTriplet = 1. + T/(1-T)*exp(-tau/tautrip)
gScan1 = exp(-(R*sin(pi*f*tau))**2/(a**2+D1*tau))
gScan2 = exp(-(R*sin(pi*f*tau))**2/(a**2+D2*tau))
gTwoD1 = F1/(1.+D1*tau/a**2)
gTwoD2 = (1-F1)/(1.+D2*tau/a**2)

# The final line with the correlation function should start with a "G"
# before the "=" sign.

G = 1./n * (gTwoD1 * gScan1 + gTwoD2 * gScan2) * gTriplet
